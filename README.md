# Beyond-The-Meds

Beyond The Meds is on a mission to help the young generation to overcome their fears and combat depression by making them aware about it and helping them communicate about their problems We provide a safe space where young people can openly express themselves and break down the stigma associated with mental health. We target at emphasing that our mental health is as important as our physical health.
